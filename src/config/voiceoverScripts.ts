  'ai-home': "Your home understands you. It studies your habits, your comfort, your rhythm. From the moment you wake up, it adjusts the light, the temperature, and the mood of the space without you asking. It learns your routines, prepares your day, and keeps everything running quietly in the background. A home that reacts with intention… almost like it knows you.",
  
  'food-intelligence': "Fresh ingredients are always within reach. Your fridge tracks what you have, what you need, and what's missing. If you run out of something, the system orders it instantly, and a drone delivers it straight to your window. Your indoor garden grows herbs and greens picked at the perfect moment. Here, eating well becomes the easiest part of your day.",
  
  'life-tech': "In the future, your home can create anything you need. A tool, a container, a missing part — all designed on the spot and printed in minutes. Your AI suggests improvements, custom sizes, even new ideas you didn't expect. The result appears right in front of you, ready to use. The home becomes a small factory that works for you.",
  
  'safety': "Safety becomes effortless. Your home anticipates risks long before you notice them. If the weather shifts, the blinds close… if something unusual happens outside, the system locks the windows and alerts you. Sensors watch quietly over every room, keeping the space calm and protected. It's a home that looks after you — always.",
